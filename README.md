NeuroML v1.8.1 Model Java API
=============================

NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop standards for the exchange of models of neuronal systems and to 
allow for greater transparency and accessibility of these complex models.

This Java library is a work in progress aimed at providing a programmatic way to access models stored in NeuroML version 1.8.1.

More details can be found on the official [NeuroML website](http://www.neuroml.org). 

Note the schemas for NeuroML version 1.8.1 are outlined here: http://www.neuroml.org/specifications.php, 
and the files have been under development on the [NeuroML Sourceforge repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/neuroml/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/web/NeuroMLFiles/Schemata/v1.8.1/). 

A collection of models in NeuroML can be found at [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org).

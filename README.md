NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop standards for the exchange of models of neuronal systems and to
allow for greater transparency and accessibility of these complex models.

**NeuroML version 1 is now deprecated. Please use NeuroML version 2.**

This Java library provides a programmatic way to access models stored in NeuroML version 1.8.1.

A collection of models in NeuroML can be found at [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org).
